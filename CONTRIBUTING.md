   - Add tests for new functionality

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   python examples/simple_test.py
   python examples/semantic_search_demo.py
   python examples/pattern_extraction_demo.py
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description
   
   - Detailed change 1
   - Detailed change 2
   - Any breaking changes noted"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Areas for Contribution

### üöÄ High Priority

1. **Federation Protocols (Phase 4)**
   - P2P knowledge sharing
   - Decentralized coordination protocols
   - Privacy-preserving knowledge exchange

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Batch processing for large vaults
   - GPU acceleration for embeddings
   - Memory optimization for large graphs

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests
   - Performance benchmarks

### üõ†Ô∏è Medium Priority

1. **Enhanced UI/UX**
   - Web dashboard for pattern exploration
   - Interactive knowledge graph visualization
   - Real-time insight generation

2. **Additional Data Sources**
   - PDF document parsing
   - Web content ingestion
   - Database connectivity

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Knowledge evolution tracking
   - Citation network analysis
   - Trend identification

### üå± Good First Issues

1. **Documentation**
   - API documentation improvements
   - Tutorial creation
   - Example expansion

2. **Configuration**
   - Additional environment variables
   - Configuration validation
   - Setup script improvements

3. **Error Handling**
   - Better error messages
   - Graceful failure recovery
   - Input validation

## Technical Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 with these specifics:
  - Line length: 100 characters
  - Use `black` for formatting
  - Type hints for public APIs
  - Docstrings for all public functions

- **Imports**: Group and order imports:
  ```python
  # Standard library
  import os
  import logging
  from typing import Dict, List
  
  # Third party
  import networkx as nx
  from anthropic import Anthropic
  
  # Local imports
  from .semantic_processor import SemanticProcessor
  ```

### Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Keep components loosely coupled
2. **Privacy**: All processing happens locally by default
3. **Extensibility**: Design for easy addition of new processors
4. **Performance**: Optimize for large knowledge bases
5. **Security**: Never commit secrets or personal data

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests** for all new functions
- **Integration tests** for component interactions
- **Performance tests** for large data sets
- **Example scripts** demonstrating new features

### Documentation Standards

- **Docstrings** for all public APIs
- **Type hints** for function parameters and returns
- **README updates** for new features
- **CHANGELOG entries** for releases

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

```python
# knowledge_node.py - Main orchestrator
class KnowledgeNode:
    """Central coordination of knowledge processing"""
    
# semantic_processor.py - Vector search
class SemanticProcessor:
    """ChromaDB and embedding management"""
    
# pattern_extractor.py - Cross-document analysis  
class PatternExtractor:
    """Pattern recognition and insight generation"""
```

### Extension Points

1. **Document Parsers**: Add support for new file formats
2. **Embedding Models**: Integrate different embedding providers
3. **Vector Stores**: Support additional vector databases
4. **Insight Generators**: Add specialized analysis modules
